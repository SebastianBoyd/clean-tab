# Square Tab

> A minimalistic but functional new tab page inspired by Mac Square's
[Splash Tab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/splash-tab/ggljjfbnnofkajgcnleiglffhhbbommh?hl=en).

No setup required.  Just vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Eventually, for backwards compatibility, use:
- post-css (with css variables and autoprefixes)
- babel (for es6, but also with closures)
- babel polyfill
- possibly webcomponents polyfill (but check when chrome implemented it
  natively)
